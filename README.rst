DECRIPTION
----------
The idea of totp-cgi came when lamenting that google-authenticator
implementation is "almost there" to be used as a generic org-wide
2-factor solution, but is annoyingly written to be a
one-secret-per-service (or -per-host) solution. Thus, totp-cgi was born,
which uses files generated by google-authenticator and serves them from
a central installation.

It is intended to be used with pam_url_.

.. _pam_url: https://fedorahosted.org/pam_url/

FEATURES
--------
1. Fully interoperable with Google-Authenticator
2. Uses Google-Authenticator-generated secret files
3. Supports pincodes (i.e. users log in with 'usercode555555')
4. Supports file-based state backend for non-redundant installations and
   Postgresql for load-balanced setups.
5. Supports encrypting the Google-Authenticator master secret with the
   user's pincode.
6. Supports web-based provisioning to generate Google-Authenticator
   compatible files (or database entries).

REQUIREMENTS
------------
1. pyotp_
2. google-authenticator_ to generate the .totp files by hand
3. flup_ (for .fcgi only)
4. psycopg2_ (for postgresql backend support)
5. py-bcrypt_ (for pincode support using bcrypt)
6. pycrypto_ and passlib_ (for encrypted-secret support)
7. pam_url_ (for PAM support)
8. python-qrcode_ (for provisioning support)
